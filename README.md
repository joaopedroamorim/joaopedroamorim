## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm JoÃ£o 

I'm from BelÃ©m-PA, currently living in SÃ£o Paulo - SP. I'm an oceanographer graduated from UFPA (2017), with a master's degree in Physical Oceanography from USP (2020). I have been working with Physical Oceanography themes since my bachelor's and I have experience on the following topics:

- Meteoceanographic data acquisition and analysis.
- Time series analysis
- Ocean-Atmosphere interaction
- Large Scale circulation
- Mesoscale circulation
- Shelf circulation (CROCO model)

I also enjoy programming, and I've been working with data analysis since 2015, here at github I intend to post and share some of the codes that I use, because I with that code-sharing is a great way to learn and evolute profissionally.
